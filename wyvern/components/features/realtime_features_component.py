    This is the base class for all realtime feature components. It contains the logic for computing the realtime
    feature. The realtime feature component can be used to compute features for a single entity, two entities, or
    a request. The realtime feature component can also be used to compute composite features for two entities.

    The realtime feature component is a generic class that takes in the primary entity, secondary entity, and request
    entity as type parameters. The primary entity is the entity that is the main entity for the feature. For example,
    if we are computing the feature for a user, the primary entity would be the user. The secondary entity is the
    entity that is the secondary entity for the feature. For example, if we are computing the feature for a user and
    a product, the secondary entity would be the product. If we are computing the feature for a user, the secondary
    entity would be None. The request entity is the request that is passed into the realtime feature component. We can
    use the request entity to compute features for a request. For example, if we are computing the realtime features for
    a ranking request, the request entity would be the ranking request. We can combine the primary entity, secondary
    entity, and request entity to compute composite features.
